You can earn experience from just about anything from cutting down trees, mining ore, hunting, killing, fishing, building, and more.. As you earn experience you will progress in levels that grant stat points and skill points you can spend in different traits that will give you increased abilities. There are currently 4 major Stats and 11 secondary Skills each with their own special attributes, more may come in the future. Stats will grant you overall character strengths while Skills grant you increased abilities when interacting with the world. For every level you increase these traits it will increase the strength of the abilities that each one gives you. The higher the level of each trait the more points it requires to reach the next level. Server owners can configure and adjust every aspect of the XPerience mod including level requirements, level multiplier, xp gained from each source, points awarded per level, point cost per level, bonuses, stat and skill strengths per level, max level of stats and skills, reset timers, and more.",
